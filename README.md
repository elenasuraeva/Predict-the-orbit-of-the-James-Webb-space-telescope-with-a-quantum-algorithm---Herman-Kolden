Since use a built-in algorithm is much more boring than make it yourself let's try to create an HHL implementation from scratch. JamesWebb.pdf is a presentation includes time evolution math evaluating, list of main variables, and a program output as an orbit. JamesWebb.ipynb is a notebook where the problem is solved using Qiskit. Note the only Task 1 is ready.
